Call your company to add or eliminate extensions or phones, as the majority of strategies are based on your minute use and an update is pushed to your account fast.

<p>Calls from your smart phone will appear as your office phone in Caller ID. Since the voice signal is broken up into information packages as an IP call, spread over the internet, and reassembled at its destination (sort of like a Star Trek transporter), rather than tying up a copper peer-to-peer landline circuit, phone calls are less costly through VoIP-- another cost savings point. Instead of using telephone lines, VoIP uses SIP trunks (SIP represents session initiation protocol).</p>
